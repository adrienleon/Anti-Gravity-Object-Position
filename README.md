# Antigravity Data Analysis

## Overview
This project includes an R script for analyzing a dataset concerning a concept referred to as "antigravity." The primary goal is to understand the relationship between position (P) and time (t) by using visualization and regression modeling techniques. Here's what the script accomplishes:

- **Data Loading**: Reads the `antigravity.csv` file, containing position-time data points.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates a plot to illustrate the position-time relationship.
- **Linear Model Fitting**: Applies a linear model to the data as a starting point.
- **Residual Analysis**: Performs a residual analysis to evaluate how well the model fits the data.
- **Cubic Model Fitting**: Fits a cubic polynomial model to the data, which may be more appropriate given the data's distribution.

## Prerequisites
Before executing this script, you must have R installed on your computer and the working directory should be set to the folder where `antigravity.csv` is located.

## Installation
No additional installations are needed to run this script, assuming R is set up on your system.

## Usage
To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Open the R script `MATH 439 Final Exam Problem 1 Adrien Leon.R` in an R environment.
2. Execute the script. Output, including plots and model summaries, will appear in your R session.
